# Installation
### Install Hugo

To use this theme you will need to have Hugo installed. If you don't already have Hugo installed please follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

### Check Hugo version (Hugo 0.51+ Extended is required)

This theme uses [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/) to compile SCSS and minify assets. Please make sure you have the **Hugo Extended** version installed. If you are not using the extended version this theme will not not compile.

To check your version of Hugo, run:

```
hugo version
```

This will output the currently installed version of Hugo. Make sure you see `/extended` after the version number, for example `Hugo Static Site Generator v0.51/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown` You do not need to use version v0.51 specifically, you can use any version of Hugo above 0.51. It just needs to have the `/extended` part

### Create a new Hugo site

```
hugo new site mynewsite
```

This will create a fresh Hugo site in the folder `mynewsite`.

### Install theme with Git

Clone this repo into the themes folder
```
cd mynewsite
git clone https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme.git themes/hugo-winston-theme
```

### Copy example content

Copy the entire contents of the `mynewsite/themes/hugo-winston-theme/exampleSite/` folder to root folder of your Hugo site, ie `mynewsite/`

To copy the files using terminal, make sure you are still in the projects root, ie the `mynewsite` folder.

```
cp -a themes/hugo-winston-theme/exampleSite/. .
```

### Update config.toml

After you copy the `config.toml` into the root folder of your Hugo site you will need to update the `baseURL`, `themesDir` and `theme` values in `mynewsite/config.toml`

```
baseURL = "/"
themesDir = "themes"
theme = "hugo-winston-theme"
```

### Run Hugo

After installing the theme for the first time, generate the Hugo site.

You run this command from the root folder of your Hugo site ie `mynewsite/`

```
hugo
```

For local development run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

# Configuration

### Config options

```
// config.toml
[params]
  google_analytics_id = ""
  twitter_handle = "@zerostaticio"
  showAuthorOnHomepage = true
  showAuthorOnPosts = false
  showPostsOnHomepage = false
  addFrame = true
  addDot = true
```

### Google Analytics

Add you google analytics ID to the `config.toml`

```
// config.toml
[params]
  google_analytics_id="UA-132398315-1"
```

# Deploying to Netlify

This theme includes a `netlify.toml` which is configured to deploy to Netlify from the `exampleSite` folder. See this discussion on how to deploy your site on Netlify from the `exampleSite` folder - https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/deploy-your-theme-to-netlify/15508

Most likely if you are deploying to Netlify and created a new Hugo site or added this theme to an existing Hugo site then you are not deploying from the `exampleSite` directory and you can delete the `netlify.toml` file.
